level0

We have an executable ./level0 that segfault :

level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

lets debug it using gdb

so basically it takes one arg and at main+25 it compares atoi(arg) with 423
if its not equal it jumps to main+152 where it prints "no !" and exits
else it store the uid and gid using getegid and geteuid functions and change them using setresgid and setresuid
then it calls execv function with /bin/bash as arg

./level0 432

we got a reverse shell with level1 privilege 
then we cat .pass and we got the flag
